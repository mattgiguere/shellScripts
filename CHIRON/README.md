**shell scripts related to CHIRON**
In this directory are shell scripts related to the [CHIRON Spectrometer](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/chiron). There are several machines used for day to day operations of the instrument:

- **ctioe1**: The data taking machine. Scripts contained in this directory are involved with the collection of new data.

- **ctimac* **: There are four ctimac machines, which all provide a user interface to CHIRON. Scripts on these machines are used for the interactive observing scripts, and the collection and transmission of data to and from CTIO.

- **exoplanets**: The file server. Scripts replicate the MySQL DB to and from CTIO and sync data and routines.

- **aramis**: Contains scripts to run the quality control and reduction pipelines.
